# Critique by Design

Among the plethora of ambitious climate goals set by president Biden, a key provision which has been in the news in last few weeks is the passage of $150 billion Clean Electricity Standrad. The goal of this standard


## The Original Visual

## Gathering Feedback
Next, I tested my wireframe by sharing it with a total of 7 people, 4 outside the class and 3 inside, asking for their feedback. All the individuals were from diverse backgrounds and it was interesting to see varied opinions on the above three options. I asked the following questions:

What do you see? Can you explain what’s going on?
Can you describe how this visualization makes you feel?
How comfortable are you reading this visualization?
Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
Is there anything you would change or do differently?
Which among the above presented options is your favorite?

Below are some of the main highlightings of the responses captured for all the three options which were presented.

Option 1: Almost all the respondents felt extremely comfortable reading the information presented in the first graph. They said that they could spot the trends in the increase in fossil fuels, mainly natural gas in the time period. One respondent suggested the inclusion of data from additional years as he thought it was interesting to have a the visibility of as many years as possible. The other user liked the use of a title and a subtitle as it effectively conveyed the message and recommended using the full unit of measurement 'Terrawatthours' on the y axis instead of just 'Twh'. It was interesting to note that only 1 out of the 7 respondents chose this graph as their favorite and the one which is the most informative to them. I believe the reason why the student preferred this was because she is from an energy background and hence is more comfortable with units such as Twh and would be interested in delving into finer details.

Option 2: This graph received a mixed reaction from the respondents. 4 out of 7 appreciated the representation of data in the stacked bar format as it gave them a clear idea of the percentage of fuel mix in each year. They also mentioned that they were able to recognize a trend in the percentage of natural gas increasing over the years and the percentage of coal decreasing. One user commented "This visualization puts me at ease. It makes me comfortable and satisfied because each stack lines up neatly at the 100% mark. It’s a tidy chart. Overall, it’s far more aesthetically pleasing." With respect to the color, she found that the color scheme was apt which is shades of red for fossil fuels and shades of green for renewables, but recommended tuning the opacity of the same shade rather than using distinct colors of green/red. This graph was well received among respondents of various backgrounds and this is mostly because, percentages are easier to understand rather than units of electricity. This option was the second most popular choice among the respondents.

Option 3: Last but not the least, Option 3 was a clear winner with 6 out of the 7 respondents choosing this as their first preference. All of them unanimously agreed that the visualization took the least amount of time and effort to understand the message. "There isn’t anything on the chart I would have to look again, to try and understand better, because it all feels well-explained", a user quoted. On the other hand, an another user suggested that the text in the area was distracting and she preferred a legend instead. Most of the respondents resonated with the fact the representation of the data in this format helps the audience derive quick insights and if interested, they could always dig deeper into each datapoint for each year to understand the percentage. In sum, this graph received the highest number of votes as the most favorite visual and I think this was mainly due to the absence of too many numbers on the visual.

A key learning for me through this exercise was that different styles of visualizations appeal to different users having diverse backgrounds. Hence, it is paramount to design the visuals keeping the audience's interests and subject matter knowledge in mind.

## The Redesign

Based on the feedback gathered, I decided to redesign two versions of the original graph both intended for a different set of audience. Option 2 below was intended toward appealing people interested in the data regarding percentage of fuel mix and would probably like to use these stats in their work or future references. In short, this option is conducive to somebody who is willing to spend more than a minute on this graph , trying to understand the trends of fuel usage across many years. Below is the redesigned version of option 2 using Fluorish.

On the basis of the most received votes, I also redesigned option 3 using Fluorish. This intention of this graph is to convey the message that almost 60% of the electricty in the US in still produced using fossil fuels in less than 30 seconds. The graph can be easily digested by a wide number of audience irrespective of them having an energy related background and any prior understanding of the topic.
