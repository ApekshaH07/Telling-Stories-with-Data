## Critique by Design

Among the plethora of ambitious climate goals set by president Biden, a key provision which has been in the news during the last few weeks is the passage of $150 billion 'Clean Electricity Standrad'. The goal of this standard is to mandate the utility providers to gradually increase the percentage of electricity produced with renewable sources of energy such as wind and solar. This is definitely the need of the hour which will play a significant role in helping the United States achieve thier zero emission targets. Unfortunately, this belief is not shared by several senators in the White House and has been a key topic of contention. I was extremely intriguied by this topic and hence wanted to understand the current fuel mix used to generate electricity in the country. Thus, for the purpose of this assignment, I chose to redseign the following graph available on the [EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) website](https://www.epa.gov/energy/learn-about-energy-and-its-impact-environment). 


## The Original Visual

The above visual is a clean line chart depicting the trends in the amount of electricity produced using various renewable and non renewable sources of energy over a number of years. Some of the key first observations from my end are as listed below.

## First Observations & Things I would change.

The first thing which stood out about this data visualization is the use of the familiar line chart to represent the fuel sources used for electricity generation in the US over a period of time. The graph was intuitive in that the dates on the x axis were arranged  from past to present and the values on the y axis were arranged in an increasing order. However, there were many significant numbers used to represent electricity generation in the US and units were difficult to understand. I liked the fact that the colors used were muted and easy on the eyes. However, in some cases, they did not conform to conventional representations  of the colors used for fuels in this field, which is blue for natural gas, yellow for solar and colors used for conventional hydroelectric and geo thermal were very close to each other. In short, the color scheme was confusing. The quarterly data representation was not easy to grasp until I referred to the title. Also, the description about the graph, tried to convey the fact that most of the electricity generation in the US is produced using fossil fuels, but the inclusion of the 'total electricity generated by different fuels' was deviating from the main message and also distorted the scale.

Things I would do differently:
- Minimize the use of colors i.e use different shades of one color for renewable and another for non renewable.
- Lighten the background gridlines.
- Since, the message is mostly about fuel mix at present, I would reduce the number of years  and showing the trend is not very important in this context.
- Clear indication on the y axis that the data is quarterly.
- Convert the values of y axis into something which is easily understood by reducing the significant figures.
- Delete the line which shows  'electricity generated by all fuels' as it distorts the scale and distracts from the main message.
- Change the title of the graph to one which conveys the right story and not just reiterates what is being shown in the graph.

## Critique using “Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile" by Stephen King

Immediately after the first observations, I used Stephen King's “Data Visualization Effectiveness Profile" to rank the visualization on various parameters. The rankings are as listed below.

**Usefulness.** Is it useful for the intended audience? Does it communicate valuable information?
**Rank given:5**

**Completeness.** Does the visualization have everything necessary to make it understandable?
**Rank given:6**

**Perceptibility.** Can the reader understand the information with minimal effort? Is the visualization type appropriate? Does it use illogical comparisons?
**Rank given:5**

**Truthfulness.** Is the visualization accurate, reliable and valid? Is it representing what it says it is, and in the most complete and truthful manner? Does it misrepresent the data or make comparisions that aren’t correct?
**Rank given:7**

**Intuitiveness.** Is it easy to understand and clearly communicates the information? If unfamiliar, does it include easy to understand instructions on how to interpret it?
**Rank given:8**

**Aesthetics.** It is interesting / enjoyable to look at? Is it a good example of what a beautiful data visualization might look like? Is it somewhere in the middle - pleasing but otherwise not distracting to look at?
**Rank given:6**

**Engagement.** Does it lead the audience to learn more about the topic? Does it inspire the audience to talk about the data or share it with others?
**Rank given:7**


## Developing the Wireframe

Based on the initial thoughts and the critique of the visualization, I proceeded to develop some wireframes to enable me envision the best possible representation of the relevant data. My first sketch was option 1 and the intent of this sketch was to improvise the exiting form of representation which is the line chart. The following improvisations were incorporated in option 1:
- The number of years on the x axis for which the data was represented, were reduced.Only complete datasets available for all the years were used.
- The use of colors were reduced by using the different shades of the same core color i.e red for fossil fuels and green for renewables.
- The significant figures of the value on the x axis was reduced and the units were converted to conventional & intutitive representation of electricity.
- The line representing 'Total electricity generated by all fuels' was removed which improved the scale of the graph.
- Changed the graph title to attract the user's attention and included a sub title to supplement better understanding.

### **Option 1 & 2**

![WhatsApp Image 2021-11-09 at 7 42 17 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81335957/140963464-46eb44fb-5224-4c79-a11c-179f440397eb.jpeg)

Though the line chart was adequate in terms of conveying the key message, I still felt that it this could be made easier to understand. With the intent of making this effective and appealing to a larger set of audience, in option 2, I used the stacked percentage bar chart. The color scheme chosen was in line with option 1 and instead of using the values of the amount of electricity produced, I switched to more intutive form of using percentages. I feel, this chart is neater in appreance as all the columns are of the same size and the data labels give an immediate insight into the fuel mix. As the color scheme of using red for something that is bad which is fossil fuels in this case and green for good which is renewables, is quite intuitive, understanding the legend also becomes extremely easy. I also chose a catchy title for the graph in order to attract the user's attention.

### **Option 3**

Lastly, i developed an option 3 mainly with an intent of not using any numbers on the visuals and yet being able to convey the right message. The best way I could do this was by using an area stacked chart as shown below. Despite being a very simple form of representation, this visualization is able to convey the message quickly and efficiently.

## Gathering Feedback
Next, I tested my wireframe by sharing it with a total of 7 people, 4 outside the class and 3 inside, asking for their feedback. All the individuals were from diverse backgrounds and it was interesting to see varied opinions on the above three options. I asked the following questions:

- What do you see? Can you explain what’s going on?
- Can you describe how this visualization makes you feel?
- How comfortable are you reading this visualization?
- Who do you think is the intended audience for this?
- Is there anything you find surprising or confusing?
- Is there anything you would change or do differently?
- Which among the above presented options is your favorite?

Below are some of the main highlightings of the responses captured for all the three options which were presented.

**Option 1:** Almost all the respondents felt extremely comfortable reading the information presented in the first graph. They said that they could spot the trends in the increase in fossil fuels, mainly natural gas in the time period. One respondent suggested the inclusion of data from additional years as he thought it was interesting to have a the visibility of as many years as possible. The other user liked the use of a title and a subtitle as it effectively conveyed the message and recommended using the full unit of measurement 'Terrawatthours' on the y axis instead of just 'Twh'. It was interesting to note that only 1 out of the 7 respondents chose this graph as their favorite and the one which is the most informative to them. I believe the reason why the student preferred this was because she is from an energy background and hence is more comfortable with units such as Twh and would be interested in delving into finer details.

**Option 2:** This graph received a mixed reaction from the respondents. 4 out of 7 appreciated the representation of data in the stacked bar format as it gave them a clear idea of the percentage of fuel mix in each year. They also mentioned that they were able to recognize a trend in the percentage of natural gas increasing over the years and the percentage of coal decreasing. One user commented "This visualization puts me at ease. It makes me comfortable and satisfied because each stack lines up neatly at the 100% mark. It’s a tidy chart. Overall, it’s far more aesthetically pleasing." With respect to the color, she found that the color scheme was apt which is shades of red for fossil fuels and shades of green for renewables, but recommended tuning the opacity of the same shade rather than using distinct colors of green/red. This graph was well received among respondents of various backgrounds and this is mostly because, percentages are easier to understand rather than units of electricity. This option was the second most popular choice among the respondents.

**Option 3:** Last but not the least, Option 3 was the clear winner with 6 out of the 7 respondents choosing this as their first preference. All of them unanimously agreed that the visualization took the least amount of time and effort to understand the message. "There isn’t anything on the chart I would have to look again, to try and understand better, because it all feels well-explained", a user quoted. On the other hand, an another user suggested that the text in the area was distracting and she preferred a legend instead. Most of the respondents resonated with the fact the representation of the data in this format helps the audience derive quick insights and if interested, they could always dig deeper into each datapoint for each year to understand the percentage. In sum, this graph received the highest number of votes as the most favorite visual and I think this was mainly due to the absence of too many numbers on the visual.

A key learning for me through this exercise was that different styles of visualizations appeal to different users having diverse backgrounds. Hence, it is paramount to design the visuals keeping the audience's interests and subject matter knowledge in mind.

## The Redesign

Based on the feedback gathered, I decided to redesign two versions of the original graph both intended for a different set of audience. Option 2 below was intended toward appealing people interested in the data regarding percentage of fuel mix and would probably like to use these stats in their work or future references. In short, this option is conducive to somebody who is willing to spend more than a minute on this graph, trying to understand the trends of fuel usage across many years. Below is the redesigned version of option 2 using Fluorish. The [excel sheet](/C:\Users\Apeksha Hudedagaddi\Desktop\CMU FALL 2021\Telling stories with Data) was edited to reflect the annual percentage fuel mix.

On the basis of the most received votes, I also redesigned option 3 using Fluorish. This intention of this graph is to convey the message that almost 60% of the electricty in the US in still produced using fossil fuels in less than 30 seconds. The graph can be easily digested by a wide number of audience irrespective of them having an energy related background and any prior understanding of the topic.
