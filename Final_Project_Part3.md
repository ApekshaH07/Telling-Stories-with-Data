 ## Reflections
 
 I really enjoyed refining my project from Part II to get my most updated final project story. I performed three main tasks:
 - Create new visualizations to support the story.
 - Incorporate images and color themes based on the moodboard created in part 2.
 - Take into account the user research and feedback and make relevant changes.

 To create visualizations and infographics based on my initial wireframes, I used the following tools :
 - Fluorish : This tool was used to create the map graphic, running numbers, word cloud and the infographic showing systemic changes.
 - Calculoid : This tool was used to incorporate an interactive calculator in my story.
 - Shorthand : This tool is primarily the skeleton of my final story. This was used to host my final website.

## Learnings from User Research
I greatly benefitted from the feedback received during the user research phase of Final Project Part 2, the critique discussions in the classroom and the feedback from the TA and the Prof. Goranson. Based on their comments , I made the following key changes in Part 3.

- Almost all the interviewees had appreciated the catchy title. However, most of them recommended the use of just one verb/noun and hence I deleted the noun'Beyond Burger' from my title.
- Since the subtitle was considered confusing for most of the users, I simplified the subtitle in the final story.
- I grouped the interactive elements of my story i.e carbon footprint calculators and personal impact calculators in the same section.
- I eliminated the visualization titled ' The United States has the largest population among the top 12 countries with the highest per capita emissions.' as it was tending towards being too much information for the audience.
- I considered the TA's feedback and improved the flow of the story to have a definite and unambiguous conclusion.
- Based on the advice of my peers in class, I explored for high resolution, good quality images on Unsplash.
- As suggested by Prof. Goranson, I developed a distinct 'Call to Action' for systemic policy based changes.
