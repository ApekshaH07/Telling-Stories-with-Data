## Comparison between different visualizations.
The first visualization option which is derived from the custom visualisation creation option on the OECD website does not give us the feasibility to use colours to highlight the countries we might be interested to monitor i.e understand the debt ratios of these countries over a period of years. The lines are all grey, difficult to distinguish and spot the difference in the performance of the various countries. However, the interactive nature of the image allows us the flexibility of hovering over differnt lines to understnad the performance of each country across several years. Since the option of the color and therefore the legend is missing, it is an extremely time consuming process.

The second visualization gives us a clear insight into how each country is performing with respect to its debt ratio over the number of years through the efficient of multiple tiny visuals. The countries are also arranged alphabetically and hence can be easily skimmed through to understand the performance of the country that interests you. However, comparison of the performance of the different countries over the number of years becomes extremely difficult and time consuming. To compare the performance of multiple countries, you are required to go back and forth across the tiny small charts and carefully observe the debt as the percentage of GDP ratio. Also, since one constant color is used for all countries, without any categorization, it becomes time consuming to find the countries of interest.

With the aim of addressing the issues in the top two visualtions , specifically colour and comparison among countries of interest, I created the thirs visualisation in Fluorish using scatter plots. The use of scatter plots help us clearly identify the performance of a country as compared to other countries each year or its performance over the number of years. Since, I was interested in observing the trends of the top 5 countries with the highest debt ratio in the previous years, I used colours to highlight those countries and colored the other countries grey. In addition, since the abbreviations of each country are sometimes not intuitive, I changed the abbreviation to full names for the countries of my interest. I feel that this form of visualization is effective in conveying the key message which is the trends of the top 5 worst performing countries in 2020 as well giving the readers flexibility in easily identifying the best performing countries over the years.
