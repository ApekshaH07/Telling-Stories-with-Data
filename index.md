# Telling-Stories-with-Data
This is my potfolio for the course 94870-B2: Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon University.

# About me
I am final semester Civil & Environmental Engineering student at Carnegie Mellon University specialising in energy efficient and sustainable design and construction. 

## What I hope to learn.
As an energy efficiency specialist,post graduation, I see myself interacting with various internal as well as external stakeholders trying to convey the importance of transitioning towards low carbon buildings on a daily basis. And the key to conveying my message effectively is great data visuals. In the span of the next few weeks, I hope to learn the tips and tricks to create impactful and visually appealing data visualisations which will help me be successful in my job.
