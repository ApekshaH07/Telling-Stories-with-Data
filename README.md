# Telling-Stories-with-Data
This is my potfolio for the course 94870-B2: Telling Stories with Data at Carnegie Mellon University.

# About me
I am final semester Civil & Environmental Engineering student at Carnegie Mellon University specialising in energy efficient and sustainable design and construction. I am extremely passionate about helping people identify opportunities to reduce energy and water consumption in their buildings and transition towards low carbon buildings. I love to geek out on topics related to building electrification, greening the electricity grid and renewable energy generation & storage.

## What I hope to learn.
As an energy efficiency specialist , I can see myself interacting with various internal/external stakeholders trying to convey the importance of transitioning towards low carbon buildings on a daily basis. And the key to conveying my message effectively is effective data visuals! In the span of the next few weeks, I hope to learn the tips and tricks to create impactful and visually appealing data visualisations which will help me succeed in my job .

# Portfolio
Keep an eye out for some exciting data visuals related to energy efficiency trends in the built environment!
