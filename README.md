# Telling-Stories-with-Data
Welcome to my portfolio for the course 'Telling Stories with Data' at Carnegie Mellon University.

Here, you will find a glimpse of all the dataviz skills I picked up from this course. I thoroughly enjoyed the rigor of this course and am grateful to the teaching team for introducing me to all the amazing dataviz resources. With this, I can now confidently bid aideu to boring graphs/infographics! :)

# About me
I am final semester Civil & Environmental Engineering student at Carnegie Mellon University specialising in energy efficient and sustainable design and construction. I am extremely passionate about helping people identify opportunities to reduce energy and water consumption in their buildings and transition towards low carbon buildings. I love to geek out on topics related to building electrification, greening the electricity grid and renewable energy generation & storage.

## My Takeaways.
As an energy efficiency specialist , I see myself interacting with various internal/external stakeholders trying to convey the importance of transitioning towards low carbon buildings on a daily basis. And the key to conveying my message effectively is effective data visuals! Throughout the duration of this course, I learnt the tips and tricks to create impactful and visually appealing data visualisations which will help me succeed in my job .
