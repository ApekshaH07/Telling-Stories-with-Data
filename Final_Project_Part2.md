## Part 2 Storyboard
After developing the story outline and wireframes in part 1, I tried to incorporate the same while developing a prelimnary version in Shorthand.

Below is the link to my [Shorthand story](https://preview.shorthand.com/o74YvxzfOPJjhCiZ?_gl=1*1nasiiq*_gcl_aw*R0NMLjE2Mzc2ODg0ODcuQ2p3S0NBaUF2X0tNQmhBekVpd0FzLXJYMUFlSXNzM1gweHV1VzZSVS10dlBHNVJPRkY0MlBXYmZ3ejI4TUJuY1lTN2M5TDFlbDN2ektSb0M1dFlRQXZEX0J3RQ..)

## Moodboard
Based on external research of already published similar stories, I developed the below moodboard to get a perspective of the colors and graphics to be used in my final story.

![Final MoodB with color](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/81335957/143033383-0dde4c26-6406-48a6-bbcb-c29f11a7906b.png)

## User Research

a.Target audiences: Any person above who is curious about their individual carbon footprint and wants to know how to contribute towards mitigating climate change.

b. Approach: In interviewed a few of my peers at school, family members and friends to understand their whether they found this story impactful.

c. Interview Questions & Responses:
- Interviewee 1 : Female, Age:28, South Asian.
- Interviewee 2: Male, Age:33, Asian.

   - Interviewee 1: Yes
   - Interviewee 2: Yes

 Q4) Choose one of the below words to describe the title of the story. Intriguing/Confusing?
   - Interviewee 1: Confusing
   - Interviewee 2: Intriguing
   - Interviewee 3: Confusing, but I'm intrigued. To be more specific, my confusion was: is this a Y/N question, or is it a question that asks which one of Beyond Burger or        biking solves climate change?
     
  Q5) What were your thoughts as you went through the story? Any surprises or disappointment?
  - Interviewee 1: Easy to follow, No unnecessary long paragraghs,Activity links keep the readers engaging, there is an action item in the end which shows that its not just a     wikipedia article, Personally I prefer less scrolling.Think about using A3 format.
  - Interviewee 2:Interesting data to represent per capita emissions across the world, My no plastic, public transport efforts are a drop in the ocean
  - Interviewee 3: Easy to read, Relevant pictures! And beautiful color balance.The ""make less babies"" makes a lot of sense but was surprising/amusing to read because of       its imperative tone ""Make your home energy efficient"".I would love to learn more about how to actually do this! Is it about conserving electricity? Not using gas           replacing light bulbs with efficient ones? Specific recommendations would be so cool"
  
  Q6)Which chart did you find the most interesting? Any suggestions on improvements?
    - Interviewee 1: World map for emissions.
    - Interviewee 2: Impact of your Carbon Footprint
    - Interviewee 3: World map! My only confusion with this one is: what do the numbers 1 and 2 mean towards the top of the graph right below the header?
     
   Q7)List a few things (1-3) you would like some clarity on?
     - Interviewee 1: References and Individual Carbon Footprint >/=/< Larger Systemic Changes?
     - Interviewee 2: Awaiting under construction/ coming soon sections
     - Interviewee 3: In the subtitle, "individual carbon footprint" is something we want to reduce, but "larger systemic changes" is something we want to implement.                Comparing two opposing forces with the inequality sign is confusing. Like I'm not sure whether the inequality sign means "better than or worse than" or if it means           "makes a larger difference or makes a smaller difference" or if it means "is more important than or is less important than". A little ambiguous.
      
    Q8)On a scale of 1-10, did you find the story interesting?
      - Interviewee 1: 7
      - Interviewee 2: 8
      - Interviewee 3: 9
       
    Q9)Any final thoughts/suggestions/improvements?
      - Interviewee 1: Bike & Beyond Burger word association needs a little improvement.
      - Interviewee 2: Great Attempt. Improve images and image placement, remove triple images (flood, climate conference farmers market).Try using two brands such as Tesla           and Beyond Burger instead or just a verb (bike) and the name of the brand.
      - Interviewee 3: Just the graphic under "make your home energy efficient!":) This is simply because I don't understand what the letters A through G                             mean. Maybe crop that letter scale part out?
       
## Future Changes

Based on the comments received during the user researcg survey and the critique sessions in the class, I will be making the following changes in my final version.

- Almost all the users liked the catchy title. However, most suggested to either   use both brands such as Tesla or Beyond burger or use just one to provide in     depth clarity. I will conduct some some surveys and try to make the title less   confusing.
- Almost all the responses recommended an improvment in the subtitle.
- Put the carbon foot print calculator sections and the calculate your impact       sections together. In sum, group the activity sections together.
- Shorten the title of my charts.
- Add a few recommendations on individual actions?
- Edit the image under 'Improve Energy Efficiency' of homes.
- Look for better pictures on Unsplash
- Complete the latter sections.
